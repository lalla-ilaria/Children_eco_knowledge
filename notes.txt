04/08/2020 Number of IRT parameters: now the model has 2 parameters, for difficulty and discrimination of the questions, 
	should we add a parameter for the probability of guessing? It represents the lower bound of the curve when k is the lowest - 
	cause you can guess the right answer. It is different between the different types of questions (e.g. true false vs freelist)

FROM WIKIPEDIA ON IRT
item response theory (IRT) is a paradigm for the design, analysis, and scoring of tests. It is a theory of testing based on the relationship between individuals' performances on a test item and the test takers' levels of performance on an overall measure of the ability that item was designed to measure. It treats the difficulty of each item (the item characteristic curves, or ICCs) as information to be incorporated in scaling items. IRT is based on the idea that the probability of a correct/keyed response to an item is a mathematical function of person and item parameters.  The person parameter is construed as (usually) a single latent trait or dimension. Examples include general intelligence or the strength of an attitude. Parameters on which items are characterized include their difficulty (known as "location" for their location on the difficulty range); discrimination (slope or correlation), representing how steeply the rate of success of individuals varies with their ability; and a pseudoguessing parameter, characterising the (lower) asymptote at which even the least able persons will score due to guessing (for instance, 25% for pure chance on a multiple choice item with four possible responses).

IRT models are often referred to as latent trait models. The term latent is used to emphasize that discrete item responses are taken to be observable manifestations of hypothesized traits, constructs, or attributes, not directly observed, but which must be inferred from the manifest responses.

IRT entails three assumptions:

A unidimensional trait denoted by {\displaystyle {\theta }}{\theta } ;
Local independence of items;
The response of a person to an item can be modeled by a mathematical item response function (IRF).


Dichotomous IRT models are described by the number of parameters they make use of. The two-parameter model (2PL) assumes that the data have no guessing, but that items can vary in terms of location ({\displaystyle b_{i}}b_{i}) and discrimination ({\displaystyle a_{i}}a_{i}). The 2PL is equivalent to the 3PL model with {\displaystyle c_{i}=0}c_{i}=0, and is appropriate for testing items where guessing the correct answer is highly unlikely,
